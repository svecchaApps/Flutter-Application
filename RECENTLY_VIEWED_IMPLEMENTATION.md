## Overview
This implementation adds recently viewed products functionality to the Flutter app, allowing users to see products they've recently viewed on the homepage.

## Features Implemented

### 1. API Integration
- **Get Recently Viewed**: `GET /recently-viewed` (with JWT authentication)
- **Track Product View**: `POST /products/:productId/track-view` (with JWT authentication)
- **Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens for secure API access

### 2. Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:
- `lib/backend/api_requests/recently_viewed_api.dart` - API service for recently viewed products
- `lib/utils/recently_viewed_helper.dart` - Utility helper for easy integration
- `RECENTLY_VIEWED_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

#### Modified Files:
- `lib/home_page/components/recently_viewed.dart` - Updated to fetch real data from API
- `lib/home_page/home_mainpage.dart` - Updated to use new component
- `lib/designer/product_description/product_description_widget.dart` - Added auto-add to recently viewed
- `lib/designer/product_description_copy/product_description_copy_widget.dart` - Added auto-add to recently viewed
- `lib/designer/product_description_color/product_description_color_widget.dart` - Added auto-add to recently viewed

### 3. Key Features

#### Automatic Tracking
- Products are automatically added to recently viewed when users visit product detail pages
- Works across all product description pages in the app

#### Real-time Display
- Recently viewed products are displayed on the homepage
- Shows product images, titles, and prices
- Handles loading states and error scenarios
- Includes refresh functionality

#### Smart UI
- Only shows the section if there are recently viewed products
- Loading indicators during API calls
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Responsive design with horizontal scrolling

#### Navigation
- Users can tap on recently viewed products to navigate back to product details
- Seamless integration with existing navigation system

## Usage

### For Developers

#### Adding to Recently Viewed
```dart
import '/utils/recently_viewed_helper.dart';

// Add a product to recently viewed
await RecentlyViewedHelper.trackProductView('product_id_here');
```

#### Getting Recently Viewed Products
```dart
import '/utils/recently_viewed_helper.dart';

// Get recently viewed products
final products = await RecentlyViewedHelper.getRecentlyViewedProducts();
```

#### Direct API Usage
```dart
import '/backend/api_requests/recently_viewed_api.dart';

// Track product view
await RecentlyViewedApi.trackProductView(productId: 'product_id');

// Get recently viewed products
final products = await RecentlyViewedApi.getRecentlyViewedProducts();
```

### For Users

1. **View Products**: Navigate to any product detail page
2. **Automatic Tracking**: Products are automatically added to recently viewed
3. **View Recently Viewed**: Go to homepage to see recently viewed products
4. **Refresh**: Tap the refresh icon to update the list
5. **Navigate Back**: Tap on any recently viewed product to view it again

## API Response Format

### Expected Response Structure
```json
{
  "message": "Recently viewed products retrieved successfully",
  "products": [
    {
      "productId": "product_id",
      "productName": "Product Name",
      "price": 99.99,
      "mrp": 99.99,
      "coverImage": "image_url",
      "description": "Product description",
      "viewedAt": "2025-08-17T13:21:43.529Z"
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 2
}
```

### Track Product View Request
```json
POST /products/:productId/track-view
// No request body needed - productId is in the URL path
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Network Errors**: Graceful fallback with retry options
- **Authentication Errors**: Handles expired tokens automatically
- **Empty States**: Hides section when no products are available
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators during API calls
- **Image Loading**: Handles broken image URLs with fallback icons

## Security

- All API calls require JWT authentication
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when needed
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- No sensitive data exposed in logs

## Performance

- Efficient API calls with proper caching
- Lazy loading of product images
- Minimal impact on app performance
- Optimized UI rendering

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the future:

1. **Local Caching**: Cache recently viewed products locally for offline access
2. **Analytics**: Track user behavior and popular products
3. **Personalization**: Show personalized recommendations based on recently viewed
4. **Sync**: Sync recently viewed across devices
5. **Categories**: Group recently viewed by product categories
6. **Search**: Add search functionality within recently viewed products

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Products not showing**: Check if user is authenticated and has JWT token
2. **Images not loading**: Verify image URLs in API response
3. **Navigation not working**: Ensure product detail routes are properly configured
4. **API errors**: Check network connectivity and API endpoint availability

### Debug Logs

The implementation includes extensive logging with emojis for easy identification:
- `üîÑ [RECENTLY_VIEWED]` - General recently viewed operations
- `üëÅÔ∏è [TRACK_VIEW]` - Tracking product views
- `üî• [RECENTLY_VIEWED]` - API calls and responses

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Login**: Ensure user is authenticated with JWT token
2. **View Products**: Navigate to several product detail pages
3. **Check Homepage**: Verify recently viewed products appear on homepage
4. **Test Navigation**: Tap on recently viewed products to ensure navigation works
5. **Test Refresh**: Use refresh button to reload the list
6. **Test Error Handling**: Disconnect network to test error scenarios
